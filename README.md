# Installation
Important: This is a plugin, not a mod! Installation is different between the two.  
To install this, download `NEOSPlus.dll` from the Releases tab and place it in the `Libraries` folder in your Neos directory.  
Next, make Neos load it by using the `-LoadAssembly` launch argument.  
When you next start Neos, Neos Plus should also be loaded and work.
